# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Overview 
  -This week my boss Jill is giving me a task to investigate and assess a csv file involving loan and credit risks being low or high and finding certain details in the data. I started by learning logistic regression being a classification model to infer if a credit card holder is going to miss a credit card payment this month or make a payment on time. For me to be making predications as I just mentioned a very useful tool I will be using is called positive predicted value(PPV) this will help me in solidifying my findings.
